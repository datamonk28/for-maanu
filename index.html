    They didn’t share a common language, yet their hearts somehow understood each other.
    The boy found a true friend in her and offered a small gift — not to impress,
    but to say thank you.
    If the girl felt it wasn’t right for her, she had every right to reject it 😅

    <h2>The Moon Thought</h2>
    <p>
    A boy calls his girl the moon, wondering if he could ever reach her —
    then the engineer inside him smiles and says,
    no worries, I’ll build a rocket.
    Funny right Maanuu?
